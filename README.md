Following the tutorials on the website to understand JavaFX.

If you download 'Graphics&Sprites.zip' directly from the website, make sure you rename ship.png to rocket.png if you are following the tutorials.

Moved the game production to https://github.com/Gagan-30/First-JavaFX-Game as Git Commits were bugged in Netbeans
